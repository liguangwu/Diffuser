# Diffuser
Diffuser is a program designed to model element diffusion in minerals. It was developed using MATLAB version 2021a and can be run by this version or later. A web version of Diffuser is available at http://www.geoapp.cn/.

After its first release, Diffuser can solve one-dimensional and composition-independent diffusion problems. More functions will be added in the future, including more flexible initial conditions, composition-dependent diffusion problems, and multi-component diffusion problems. Any update also will be seen on the web app.
# 2022.5.30 Update
A beta version of **Diffuser (Numerical)** is available at https://github.com/liguangwu/DiffuserNumerical/. It uses numerical methods to calculate time with uncertainty propagation of curve fitting, temperature, and experimentally determined diffusion coefficients. Distinguished from the first version of Diffuser which uses analytical solutions, it is designed for solving more complex diffusion problems, such as composition-dependent Fe-Mg diffusion in olivine. Any bug report can be sent to wlg@cugb.edu.cn.
# 2025.10.28 Update
Add a function for Diffuser to automatically calculate a specific cooling rate and its corresponding timescale at which diffusion just ceases at the measured profile.
