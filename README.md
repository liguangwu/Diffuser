# Diffuser
Diffuser is a program designed to model element diffusion in minerals. It was developed using MATLAB version 2021a and can be run by this version or later. A web version of Diffuser is available at http://www.geoapp.cn/.
After its first release, Diffuser can solve one-dimensional and composition-independent diffusion problems. More functions will be added in the future, including more flexible initial conditions, composition-dependent diffusion problems, and multi-component diffusion problems. Any update also will be seen on the web app.
